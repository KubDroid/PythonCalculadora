This is a simple calculator made with Python and the Tkinter library.

The code is divided into two parts: the first part creates the window and the widgets, and the second part defines the functions that are called when the user clicks on a button.

To create the window, we use the `Tk()` function. This function creates a new window and returns a reference to it. We then set the title of the window to "Calculator" using the `title()` method.

To create the widgets, we use the `Button()` function. This function creates a new button and returns a reference to it. We then pass the text that we want to appear on the button, the width and height of the button, and the command that we want to be executed when the button is clicked.

The functions that are called when the user clicks on a button are defined in the second part of the code. These functions are responsible for adding the text to the entry widget, clearing the entry widget, and evaluating the expression in the entry widget.

The `click_boton()` function is called when the user clicks on a button that has a number or a mathematical operator. This function adds the text of the button to the entry widget.

The `borrar()` function is called when the user clicks on the "AC" button. This function clears the entry widget.

The `hacer_operacion()` function is called when the user clicks on the "=" button. This function evaluates the expression in the entry widget and displays the result in the entry widget.

To add the buttons to the window, we use the `grid()` method. This method takes the row and column of the button, as well as the padx and pady parameters. The padx and pady parameters control the amount of space that is added around the button.

To run the program, we simply execute the `mainloop()` method. This method enters the main event loop and waits for the user to interact with the window.
